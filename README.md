<h1 align="center">Velato JS, A Hands-Free Programming Language</h1>

Write JavaScript by whistling.

Built on the [original Velato language](https://github.com/rottytooth/Velato), but with a simplified grammar for whistling.

Libraries:
* [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)
* [ML5.js](https://ml5js.org/)
* [VexTab](https://vexflow.com/vextab/)

[All of these are in the lib folder already -- apologies for the inconsistent approach to packages, I didn't know what I was doing when I started this...]
