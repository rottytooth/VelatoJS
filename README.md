<h1 align="center">Velato JS, A Hands-Free Programming Language</h1>

Write JavaScript by whistling.

Built on the [original Velato language](https://github.com/rottytooth/Velato), but with a simplified grammar for whistling.

## FAQ

**Is the correct name of this language Velato JS or Velato Hands-Free?**

Both / either, possibly will change again for any or no reason.

**Is this the same language as Velato?**

They are built on the same idea but have different uses and grammars. Classic Velato is a multicoding language, where a programmer composes a piece of music within the constraints of the algorithm they want to implement. This version of the language has more immediacy; code is written live.

**Why is the grammar different from both Velato and JavaScript?**

Velato Hands-Free has a lexicon and grammar based on Classic Velato but minimized for whistling. Velato and JS use a mix of prefix and infix operators and have parantheses for order of operations. All commands and expressions in this language are prefix and executed in order. No end-of-line marker (`;`) is needed, nor parantheses.
