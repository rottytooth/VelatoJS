## FAQ

**Is the correct name of this language Velato JS or Velato Hands-Free?**

Both / either, possibly will change again for any or no reason.

**Is this the same language as Velato?**

They are built on the same idea but differ in purpose and syntax. Classic Velato is a [multicoding language](https://stars.library.ucf.edu/elo2020/asynchronous/proceedingspapers/17/), where a programmer composes a piece of music within the constraints of the algorithm they want to implement. This version of the language has more immediacy; code is written live.

**Why is the grammar different from both Velato and JavaScript?**

Velato Hands-Free has a lexicon and grammar based on Classic Velato but minimized for whistling. Both Velato and JS use a mix of prefix and infix operators and have parantheses for order of operations. All commands and expressions in this language are prefix and executed strictly in order. No end-of-line marker (`;`) is needed, nor parantheses.
